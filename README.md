- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sayantan19
- 👀 I’m interested in anything and everything for now, since I am still exploring my avenues
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack development on Python Flask and the usual college stuff
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to web designing for now, cause that is something that I can do to a certain extent
